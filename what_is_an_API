What is a web API?

API = Application Programming Interface

A web API acts as the in-between for your website's server and another service's server. For example, if you wanted to have a button on your website that
would show the user the current location of every McDonalds on the planet, you would have to use Google Map's API. The user would hit the button and send a 
request to your server asking for the info, but you don't have that information. So you use the API developed by Google to have your website ask their 
database for that information, then your server responds to the user and presents the newly aquired information. The API is just serving the information 
from another service's database or server.
